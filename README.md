Instructions:
Firstly,download the jupyter notebook uploaded, and then download the image folders named as +photos1 for detector which consists of images of Virat Kohli, +photos2 for detector which consists of images of Messi,-negative photos for detector which consists of images of Akshay Kumar and test_photos which consists of mixed up images i.e. of several persons.Then keep this image folders in the same directory as the jupyter notebook. The image folders +photos1 for detector and +photos2 for detector consists of the images on which the neural network is trained positively and -negative photos for detector consists of images on which the neural network is trained negatively.Then run the jupyter notebook and you can see the training accuracy and finally test the images present in the test_images folder.
